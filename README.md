# URL Shortener Project 🔗

## Project Overview

This project is a URL shortening service that allows users to create shorter, more manageable links from long URLs. It provides analytics on the shortened URLs, such as the number of visits, device types, and operating systems used to access them. The frontend is built with React and Vite, while the backend uses Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL (Neon DB).
